♬The next best social media platform♬
we are making a new social network
its called dumpsterfire
4chan meets myspace, meets facebook reddit and youtub
only voice message threads
and only voice message comments
with a customizable profile, friend requests
but everything is only voice
when you open the browser or app
its a vast space
imagine exploring space as you click around
each star is a random voice message
there is 4 categories, chill, controversial, music, and one more
each side of the screen as you scroll gets more intense
no computer AI, all user rated
click a star hear the voice topic, double click the thread with voice comments
less trolls, no bots
hard to manipulate
less propaganda
real voices
nothing based on twerking or your appearance
anything goes, say anything you want
saying nigger in a forum flies, but if you say nigger nigger nigger in a squeeker voice your thread gets filled with deep voice black men talking shit about you beeing a little white squeeker
i already set up a meeting for money with a dev team to see what it would cost
monday*
fuck a forum
lets make the next best social network
